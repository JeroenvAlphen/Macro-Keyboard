Thank you for using my macro keyboard!

Download all files from this repository and put then in a folder together.
When starting the .exe file it will start in your hidden pictrograms (litte arrow to the side of your time on your taskbar).

when right clicking the 'Macro M' you can choose the option 'Edit Hotkeys'. This will open the GUI of the macro keyboard.
Here you can insert specific path to for example file locations or executable locations. With the play button you can test the inserted paths. 

You also have hardcoded programs, more programs will follow and if you have any that you want added, hit me up so I can see what I can do:
